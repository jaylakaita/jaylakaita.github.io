This is my third year at the University of Manoa and my first semester in Shidler! Even though I lived on Oahu my entire life I can't remember any of the street names. I am an introvert so I apologize in advance if I don't talk to you or seem like I am avoiding eye contact at all costs. 

Although I am not great at these things I like drawing, photography, and gardening. I had recently purchased an iPad and downloaded the ProCreate app in hopes to advance my drawing skills and learn how to draw using a device. Last winter, I purchased a camera to indulge in my interest of photography. For a long time I took pictures with my phone, but now I'm able take photos with much better quality. Also, I have become fond of gardening and I am currently trying to make compost so I can grow fresh vegetables!
