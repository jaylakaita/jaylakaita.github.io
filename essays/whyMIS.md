I am currently majoring in Marketing and plan on double majoring or minoring in MIS. I want to pursue a career where I can create visually pleasing content that immediately catches a person's attention. I initially went into marketing because I was fascinated with how market research analysts are able to study consumer behavior and can identify what a person wants. As I mentioned in my "Introduce Yourself" essay I like drawing, so I would like to make designs or work on projects that include creative visuals. 

I had only become aware of MIS after I got into UH. I learned about MIS from the ITMA club. What I hope to overall get out of ITM 352 is to have some knowledge of web design. I have no prior experience in coding, but I look forward to what I will be learning!
